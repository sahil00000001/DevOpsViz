### C. Layout System
**Spacing Units**: Consistent use of Tailwind units 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16
- `p-4` for card padding
- `gap-6` for grid layouts
- `mb-8` for section spacing
- `mx-2` for tight horizontal spacing

### D. Component Library

**Navigation**
- Top header with project selector and sprint dropdown
- Breadcrumb navigation for drill-down views
- Sidebar navigation for different dashboard sections

**Data Display**
- Metric cards with large numbers and trend indicators
- Interactive charts using Chart.js/D3 with dark theme
- Data tables with sorting, filtering, and pagination
- Kanban-style boards for work item visualization

**Interactive Elements**
- Primary buttons in Azure blue with subtle hover states
- Filter chips for quick data segmentation
- Search bars with real-time filtering
- Notification badges for dependency alerts

**Overlays**
- Modal dialogs for detailed work item views
- Tooltip overlays for metric explanations
- Loading states with skeleton screens

### E. Dashboard Layout Strategy

**Grid System**
- 12-column responsive grid using CSS Grid
- Dashboard widgets in 4, 6, 8, or 12 column spans
- Consistent 6-unit gap between dashboard cards

4. **Team Performance**: Individual contributor metrics and PR status
5. **Dependencies**: Visual representation of blocked items and review queues

### F. Data Visualization Principles

**Chart Types**
- Burndown charts for sprint progress
- Donut charts for completion percentages
- Bar charts for individual team member performance
- Timeline views for PR review workflows

**Interactive Features**
- Click-through to Azure DevOps work items
- Hover states revealing additional context
- Real-time updates with subtle animation indicators
- Dependency highlighting on selection

**Performance Considerations**
- Lazy loading for large datasets
- Pagination for work item lists
- Efficient API calls with caching
- Progressive enhancement for complex visualizations

This design creates a professional, data-focused dashboard that prioritizes clarity and actionable insights while maintaining visual appeal through strategic use of Azure's brand colors and modern interface patterns.
